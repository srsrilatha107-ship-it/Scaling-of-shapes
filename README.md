# üìê Scaling of Shapes ‚Äì OpenGL Mini Project

**Scaling of Shapes** is a mini project developed using OpenGL and C++ to demonstrate the interactive scaling of 2D geometric shapes such as triangle, rectangle, and circle. The program allows users to dynamically switch between shapes and scale them up or down in real-time using simple keyboard inputs. Designed with a red-on-black color scheme for visual clarity, the project serves as a practical implementation of basic computer graphics concepts like transformation and rendering.
